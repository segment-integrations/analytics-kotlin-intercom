Please direct all issues, bug reports, and feature enhancements to `friends@segment.com` so they can be resolved as efficiently as possible. 

## Adding the dependency

To install the Segment-Intercom integration, simply add this line to your gradle file:

```
implementation 'com.segment.analytics.kotlin.destinations:intercom:<latest_version>'
```

Or the following for Kotlin DSL

```
implementation("com.segment.analytics.kotlin.destinations:intercom:<latest_version>")
```



## Using the Plugin in your App

Open the file where you setup and configure the Analytics-Kotlin library.  Add this plugin to the list of imports.

```
import com.segment.analytics.kotlin.destinations.intercom.IntercomDestination
```

Just under your Analytics-Kotlin library setup, call `analytics.add(plugin = ...)` to add an instance of the plugin to the Analytics timeline.

```
    analytics = Analytics("<YOUR WRITE KEY>", applicationContext) {
        this.flushAt = 3
        this.trackApplicationLifecycleEvents = true
    }
    analytics.add(plugin = IntercomDestination(applicationContext))
```

Your events will now begin to flow to Intercom in device mode.
